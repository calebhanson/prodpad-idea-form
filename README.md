# prodpad-idea-form
How to use this mini-tool: 
1) either call it from localhost or put it up on a server somewhere, it has to be called over http:// or https://, can't be file://
2) call the url, and pass in 2 paramaters: creator id and api key (as "key"), like "http://myhost.com/idea_form.html?key=xxxx&creator=1234"
3) Bookmark that URL for easy access. Do NOT post that URL anywhere, as it exposes your API key
4) This is also designed to work on iPhone, hence the touch icon. If it's up on a server, you can open the URL in safari and add it to the home screen.
